When I was thinking of ways to improve my JavaScript logic, I figured I would make a website using only JavaScript. However, I realized that writing element.style... every time would make my code hundreds of lines long, so I decided to use CSS to save some time. I got this idea while sitting in class and learning how to use JavaScript append and createElement functions, but I wasn't really understanding them. I was practicing JavaScript weeks before, but I couldn't catch up to everything we were learning, so I decided to do this big project to learn more.
 
After finishing this project, which took me 3 days, I had the feeling after that I finally understood how JavaScript is supposed to be written. This was one of my best decisions to start doing because it really helped me understand how JavaScript works.
 
That being said, that doesn't mean that my code had no errors; in fact, it was filled with them. But I think the most important thing is that the site looks 95% like it should look without functions.
 
I tried making some interactive functions, but it was still a little too early for me to try doing that, and just by looking at it, anyone who knows coding could tell.
 
But still, this is one of my most proudest projects that I ever did.
 
This took me 3 days.
